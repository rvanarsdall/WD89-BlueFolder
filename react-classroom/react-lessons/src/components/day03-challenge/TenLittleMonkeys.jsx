// 1. Create a Functional Component called TenLittleMonkeys
// 2. Use useState to set the initial Monkey Count to 10
// 3. Display how many monkeys are left in a sentence that says the following...
// 10 little monkeys jumping on the bed one fell off and hit his head. Mama called the doctor and the doctor said. No more monkeys jumping on the bed!
// 4. Once the count gets to zero display "All the Monkeys fell off"
// 5. Button clicking should take 1 away from the total monkey counter

// Have UseState
// Have a Button
// function that when called it will update the state of monkeysLeft
// Once the monkeys = 0 we need to update our display of text
